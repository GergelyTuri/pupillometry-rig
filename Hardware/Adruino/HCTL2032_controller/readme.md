# Arduino file for HCTL2032 controller

The only task of this script is to read the encoder value from the HCTL2032 controller and print it to the serial monitor. The script is written for Arduino Nano board. Make sure you use hte "old bootloader" to upload the code to the board.

The script was updated on 7/31/2024 by GT. VSCODE's compiler was used to compile the code and it did it without any errors. However when it was uploaded to the Nano via the Arduino IDE, the compiler threw a lot of warnings.
